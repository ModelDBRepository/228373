The Readme.md in the modeling folder contains the instructions:

---
Seizure-Waves

Run the function runseizingcortical_field.m to generate a simulation
of a seizure.

Two simulation scenarios are implemented which differ in the source of
seizure activity: a fixed cortical source, and an ictal wavefront.

The results are visualized as a series of maps, as in Figure 5c of the
manuscript.

A 10 s interval of the ECoG data are saved for wave analysis.

Please see comments inside of the file runseizingcortical_field.m for
more details.

As the runseizingcortical_fields.m model runs a matlab figure:

displays (a movie) of wave phenomena and other activity.

Under the analysis folder running the main_seizure_waves.m program
generates these images:
